# CS-340-Dashboard

   
    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is vital when developing software. When I was developing the CRUD python module I took care to write appropriate comments and keep the variables consistent and easy to understand for any future modifications. The advantage that this carried over when working on project two as I was able to more easily add more components to the CRUD module for filtering. I was also easily able to call the components of the Python module throughout the project. 


    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

There were many problems I encountered and I have a variety of techniques that I used to tackle them. Firstly I like to break big problems into smaller ones, for example, to get the Pi chart to display and update properly I first tackled getting the Pi chart to display properly- then I focused on getting it to update according to input. This method works well for large problems. I also tackle problems by examining what I know, what I need, and where I need to get to. By answering the question "What information do I need" I can often begin to solve many problems. 

    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?
    
Computer scientists solve issues relating to technology. this type of work can help companies grow and develop their systems in new ways, for example building a new dashboard with comprehensive features. this is important as a science and economic tool
